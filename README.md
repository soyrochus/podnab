# podnab
Nabbing (to take, grab, or steal (something)) Podcasts for fun

## Introduction

Podnab will be a podcast manager (inc rudimentary player). It's is NOT a serious effort to create a mature entry in the field of podcast managers. There are quite enough of those already. Rather, it's more of a playground for [gtk4-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/), the Rust bindings for [GTK4](https://gtk.org/). However, it is still supposed to be a "proper" app which might be usefull as a tutorial of sorts.
